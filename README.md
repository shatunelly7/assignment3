        <h1>WINTER</h1>
        <P style="color:rgb(84, 4, 87)">Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate zones. It occurs between autumn and spring. The tilt of
        Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs when a hemisphere is oriented away from the Sun. Different cultures define
        different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.
